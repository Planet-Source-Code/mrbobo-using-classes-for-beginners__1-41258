## Using Classes for Beginners


</div>

### Description

A practical demonstration of using classes to optimise your applications.

Correctly written classes make your code re-usable, faster, more reliable and memory efficient.

They also speed devolopment time, make debugging easier and can be placed in DLL's making them accessable from multiple applications simultaneously

As time goes by they become even better because each time you use the same class in different apps, any bugs that do show up get removed for future apps as well.
